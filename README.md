# Sibedge.Plv8Server

Library for developing Asp.NET applications using PLV8 Framework.

See the demonstration application [here](https://github.com/alexeyfadeev/plv8-backend-demo).

## PLV8 Framework

This tool is designed to integrate [PLV8 Framework](https://github.com/sibedge-llc/plv8-framework) into Asp.NET applications.
The framework simplifies PLV8 development (to create stored functions for PostgreSQL on JavaScript language).

The two main purposes of PLV8 Framework are:
- Use of exisiting universal PLV8 functions that implement CRUD API to PostgreSQL objects.
- Develop your own PLV8 functions (convenient for reports and complex data structure).
